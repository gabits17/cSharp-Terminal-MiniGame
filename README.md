# Tiny C# terminal mini-game
A basic console mini-game implemented while following the final module of the [*Create methods in C# console applications (Get started with C#, Part 5)*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-c-sharp-part-5/) learning path. This repo demonstrates it using small, but well-structured methods to implement basic gameplay logic and user input handling in a console application.

Microsoft offers a [starter skeleton](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Challenge-project-Create-methods-in-CSharp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to complete. 

I built this to complete the 5th learning path of **Microsoft's Free C# Foundations Course** and finished the mini-game to practice my C#, input handling and game loops skills and to prepare for upcoming work with .NET and C#.

### Main Features
This mini-game consists on a player that can go left, right, up and down inside the console's dimensions.
- Detect when the player consumes food
- Update player state depending on the food that is consumed
- (Re)generate random food at a random location after its consumption

### Pre-requisites to execute the code:
- `.NET` SDK should be installed
- `.NET` Runtime should be installed

### To execute the code:
- Enter `git clone <URL>` on the desired directory
- Go to project folder `cd path/to/project-folder`
- Enter `dotnet build` to compile the code and create the necessary output in a build folder
- Enter `dotnet run` to play. Enjoy!
